## Write Up

### Tools Used
* React: I'm a huge React fan and love how easy it makes to manage state
* Javascript
* HTML/SCSS: SCCS since it allows us to define constants and can help reduce redundancy when styling similar components

### Features
* Showing all events sorted by event start time
* Hiding private events with a login screen
* The user can view related events by clicking the link and the page will scroll to the related event
* Filtering events by type
* Searching for events
* User can like events and view them separately

### Design Decisions and Development Process

#### Design Planning
I looked through the requirements and created an outline for how I'd like to display the events through figma. Here is my design page for reference, [https://www.figma.com/file/PQ0NkYpVmuUpmMZzkvLpq6/HTN'22-Application?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/PQ0NkYpVmuUpmMZzkvLpq6/HTN'22-Application?node-id=0%3A1). In terms of the colours, I wanted it feel warm/welcoming so I used yellow and pink and the main colours and added others to make it more fun and playful.
